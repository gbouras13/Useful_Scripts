* get_subseq.py - requires infile (-i) start coordinate (-s) and end coordinate (-e) and will output the fasta subseqeuence.
* translate.py - translates nucleotide to amino acid fastas
* terminase_orienter.py - orients a phage genome fasta to begin with the terminase in the positive strand
* terminase_orienter_gff_for_brig.py - does the same but with the gff annotation file, then feeds in the output for BRIG
